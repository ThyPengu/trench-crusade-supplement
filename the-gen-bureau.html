        <h1>The Bureau of Gen</h1>
        
        <p>
The entity known today as The Gen Bureau; a cold, shortened appellation that speaks to its functional nature. In its current iteration the organisation is a mere ninety years old. Yet, this organization is but the most recent, most clinical mask worn by a lineage stretching back to times long before the Crusades.
        </p><p>
Full-scale skirmishes against the Bureau of Gen are rare events, yet records confirm their occurrence has grown more frequent over the last decade of the Crusade. However, finding oneself in a battle against the Bureau almost certainly means one was neither expecting it nor prepared for it.</p>

        <h2>Origins</h2>

        <div class="two-column">
            <div>
                <p>
                    Even before the founding of New Antioch and the commencement of the First True Crusade, disparate sects and clandestine organisations across the Old World coalesced, seeking to hone the razor edge of humanity against the infernal tides. Many of these groups pre-dated the Church's iron grip by millennia. Many more did not survive the decades of chaos that followed the initial Shattering of Jerusalem.
                </p>
               <p>
                    The Bureau is composed from many intellectual dregs and hardened survivors of heretical groups of yore, primarily; The Rosenkreuzer, but also surviving remants of the Krsnik, the ritualistic Order of the Benandanti, and the esoteric Foliate Church. To speak these names in the presence of the Church invites immediate inquisition; to speak them near the Bureau itself is to invite a fate of redaction.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>
The Bureau's modus operandi and heretical beliefs have ensured its status as a most wanted, vilified, and hunted entity throughout history; now more so than ever. The Bureau’s principal belief is Nullifidianism; the complete rejection of divine and infernal power as anything more than a material force. In the current age, where miracles are a daily, demonstrable reality, Nullifidians are shaken off as denialist maniacs and considered mere kindling for the pyres of the zealous.
                </p>
               <p>
The truth is more complex, and thus, more dangerous. The Bureau does not doubt the power of the celestial and chthonic realms; it merely denies their Divinity and, by strict opposition, their Infernality. To accept the cold, mathematical invitation to join the Bureau is to be hunted by all sides. To be discovered by an enemy is to guarantee swift death if one is lucky, and an extensive, interrogative torture otherwise.

        <h2>Clandestine Operation Eternal</h2>

        <p>
The power of the Bureau resides entirely in its secrecy, a skill it has honed through millennia of evolutionary survival. Within the Bureau's functional hierarchy, every scholar is by cold extension a spy, and every soldier is an assassin. Initially their negligible numbers have allowed them to embed themselves like a parasite into the very structural organs of power across the globe for centuries. Since the Crusades they had had centures to fortify amass, and tool an army of their own, in secrecy. Their great minds are bent not on faith, but on progress, feeding vast intelligence networks to minds of strategic importance across every active front.</p><p>
On more than one documented occasion, entire Graukompagnie battalions have been used as sacrificial decoys to ensure the safe, secret completion of sensitive data-gathering objectives. With deep-rooted spy networks and specialized technologies hooked directly into enemy lines of communication, entire fronts both hallowed and accursed alike, have moved to the precise, clinical manipulations of the Bureau. Yet, such acts are performed sparingly, for a spider weaving a web is not impervious to those looking down from above, or below.</p><p>Do not mistake this lack of faith for an absence of Zealotry. Fanaticism is no less rife in the ranks of the Bureau than it is in the Church or the Heretic Legions. To the Bureau, no cost is too high in the pursuit of quantified progress; to understand the very material plaguing the minds of men and women, calling into question the nature of reality itself. To keep their minds sharp and their logic pure, many Bureau scientists voluntarily undergo primary lobotomies should they feel their sanity slipping; a procedure the Bureau has perfected. It is, in fact, considered a great honour to receive the senary leucotomy granted upon a promotion to Major General.
</p>
      <h2>Technology</h2>
      <div class="two-column">
            <div>
                <p>
The Bureau's iconoclastic views and parasitic infestation of organizational structures are not the only reasons for their persecution. Perhaps more justified is the perceived, and often quite real, theft of technologies, ranging from high-Church relic prototypes and Sultanate weapon schematics to recovered demonic artifacts. The most profane example is the flagrant acquisition of a partial charcoal rubbing of the fabled Smaragdine Tablet.
                </p>
               <p>
It is perhaps for this reason the Bureau holds an intense, logical paranoia regarding their own terrifying array of technologies falling into the wrong hands. Innovations are used sparingly, and are always protected by destructive safeguards. All their dedicated intelligence operatives are surgically implanted with a Revelatory Detonator. As of yet, no Bureau spy has been salvagable upon postmortem capture. 
              </p>
              </div><div>
               <p>
                 Resultantly, the Gen Bureau has ascended into something of a no-man's-land bogeyman across all active fronts. Its presence is generally reported only through word-of-mouth testimony from frontline soldiers, recounting desperate, fragmented glimpses of unseen technology in action—tales of operatives who can seemingly see, hear, and run through solid earth and concrete.
 </p>
               <p>
At other times, the Bureau is less subtle, deploying rampaging laboratory machinations in situations where maximum chaos, or a clean house is required. Such as the documented, 'von Baer Deployment', known colloquially among the surviving regiments of the Church and the Legions as the "Trench Grinder."
                </p>
            </div></div>
            <p>The Bureau’s most frequent and critical military operations into the desolate expanse of no-man’s-land are not skirmishes for ground, but calculated, high-risk assignments dedicated to the investigation and retrieval of materials deemed of paramount technological or Aetheric interest </p>
        <div>
      <h2>Organisation</h2>
      <div class="two-column">
<div>
<p>Although the exact structure of the Bureau's command authority remains a complete cipher to all but those at the very apex of its hierarchy, it is known that the supreme command is vested in seven figures, referred to internally as the Seven Crowns. One of these reported 'Crowns' is the alchemical legend, Nicolas Flamel . Flamel is said to have long since been subject to the logical ravages of age and the pursuit of Aetheric knowledge, having lost the ability to hear or speak. His continued function as a Director is facilitated through the use of a proprietary, punch-card operated drum-feed system, serving as his sole method of communication, both inbound and outbound.</p>
<p>
It must be noted, for the purposes of completing this dossier, that only one external informant has ever successfully managed to infiltrate the Bureau deep enough to acquire intelligence of any meaningful value: a skilled Sultanate operative from the 'Akhawat al-'Abadia (the Sisters of Eternity). Yet, many of her subsequent claims were ultimately deemed too outlandish to be credible, including the preposterous details regarding the longevity of an aged alchemist deep beneath the sea.
</p>
</div><div>
                <p>
Even Bureau operatives of significant rank are often unaware of the ultimate location of its Central Headquarters. It is believed that many decentralized strongholds exist, inherited from the various heretical organizations absorbed throughout its history.
                </p>
               <p>
Given how the Bureau very sparingly shows its hand in the form of mobilization, it is reasonable to suggest that the ruins near Kyllini harbor a stronghold; given recent troop movements. Principality of New Antioch intelligence suggests the existence of at least one fortified base of operations within the Northern Swiss Alps, yet, even if more tactical evidence was gathered, It would be difficult to justify an offensive that diverted troops away from more infernal fronts. 
                </p>
<p>
                 More outlandish stories pertaining to the Bureau's headquarters range from a fortress constructed on the Lunar Far Side to a sunken sanctuary in the abyssal trenches of Calypso Deep. For those that have witnessed and survived the rare moments The Gen Bureau shows its clandestine hand, it does not seem so outlandish.
